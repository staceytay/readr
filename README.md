Readr - http://staceytay.com/readr/
===================================

A simple RSS feed aggregator based on Safari's shared links, built using React
and Firebase. Design heavily inspired by Chee Aun's awesome
[HackerWeb](http://cheeaun.github.io/hackerweb/).

I built this because Safari's shared links somehow doesn't support a number of
feeds that I want to follow and I wanted to experiment with React and JS. Also
thought it would be cool if I could fully customize my RSS reader.
